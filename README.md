# PuzzleMage AI

PuzzleMage AI utilizes the power of machine learning and computer vision to solve classic puzzle games like sudoku and crossword puzzles. Technologies that we have incorporated into PuzzleMage AI include OpenCV, MongoDB, augmented reality, Python, Svelte, and Flask. The user will be able to present the puzzle to the program through the use of a webcam, phone camera, picture, etc. and PuzzleMage AI will use augmented reality to display the solution to the given puzzle.

## Tech Stack

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - Open Source Javascript Framework.
